# Netflix Strategy Analysis

This project analyzes Netflix's content release strategy and viewership patterns using data from 2023. The analysis includes investigating release trends by season, month, and day of the week, as well as exploring how major holidays and events correlate with content releases and viewership.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand:

- The distribution of Netflix content releases across different months, seasons, and weekdays.
- Viewership patterns and how they are influenced by the timing of content releases.
- The correlation between major holidays and events and content release strategies.
  
## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

- **Title**: Name of the content released on Netflix.
- **Available Globally?**: Whether the content is available globally.
- **Release Date**: Date when the content was released.
- **Hours Viewed**: Total hours the content was viewed.
- **Language Indicator**: Language of the content.
- **Content Type**: Type of content (e.g., Movie, TV Show).
- **Release Year**: The year the content was released.
- **Release Month**: The month the content was released.
- **Release Season**: The season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) when the content was released.
- **Release Day**: Day of the week when the content was released.

## Analysis

### 1. Seasonal Trends
We explore how the number of releases and viewership hours vary across seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).

### 2. Monthly Release Patterns
The analysis identifies trends in content releases and their corresponding viewership hours on a monthly basis.

### 3. Weekly Patterns
We analyze which days of the week are most favored for content releases and how they correlate with the viewership hours.

### 4. Holiday Influence
We explore if there is a correlation between Netflix content releases and significant holidays/events like New Year’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Independence Day, Halloween, and Christmas.

## Visualizations

- **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between variables such as release dates and viewership hours.
- **Heatmaps**: Illustrate patterns in the data.
- **Box Plots**: Help identify trends, quartiles, and outliers in content release patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plots.
